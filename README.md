## `sql_to_nl/sql_to_nl.py`
This Python module converts SQL queries into natural language descriptions.  
It analyzes SQL queries and generates clear, comprehensive natural language questions that preserve the logical structure of the original query.  
The LLM used is **Llama 3 70B**, running locally through **Ollama**, with **temperature = 0** to ensure deterministic outputs.

## `sql_to_nl/sql_nl_*.json`
These files contain the JSON output produced by `sql_to_nl.py`, pairing each SQL query with its corresponding natural language translation.

## `qgen.sh`
This shell script automates SQL query generation and is intended to be used together with **SQLsmith** to generate random queries.
the '--target' option is used to target postgres db.

## `queries_*.sql`
These files contain the SQL queries generated by SQLsmith when running the `qgen.sh` script.  
To target a different database, update the `DB_TARGET` variable (note that the target database and its tables must already exist in PostgreSQL).
